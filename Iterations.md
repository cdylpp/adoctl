# Iterations

Iterations allow us to track work over time. 

Assign iterations by fiscal year, quarter, then number in quarter. 
For example, suppose we the date February 3rd, 2026, the sprint number would be 

>`Black Lagoon\[Team]\FY26-Q2-03`, 

i.e, the fiscal year 2026, second quarter, third sprint.
