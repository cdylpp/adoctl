# Critical Business Decision


**Definitions**
A _critical business decision_ (or decision) is a choice point where alternative paths carry meaningful impact on cost, scope, strategy alignment, compliance, or stakeholder value and where delay, inconsistency, or misalignment could introduce risk to delivery or product outcomes.

This signal is not for routine task-level decisions. It is reserved to flag decisions that require deliberate visibility, shared accountability, and possible executive or cross-functional escalation. The purpose of tagging these items enables upward visibility, traceability, and time-bound review.

**Rule of Elevation:** If the decision cannot be owned at the current level due to uncertainty, cross-team implications, or misalignment concerns, then escalate one level up with context, options, and a recommendation.
