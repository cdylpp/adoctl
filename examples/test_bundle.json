A dashboard fed by ADO data provides real-time transparency.\n\n**Constraints:**\n- Must use approved ADO data source (Analytics/OData or approved alternative)\n- Time-in-status calculations require state change history\n- Dashboard must support filtering for practical analysis\n- Refresh cadence must be reliable and documented\n\n**Definition of Done:**\n- Dashboard is fed from validated ADO data source\n- Displays current count of requests by status\n- Shows time-in-status metrics (average, median, aging)\n- Supports filtering by date range, priority, sponsoring org\n- Refresh cadence is established and reliable\n- Validation performed on sample set (manual spot-check vs ADO history)\n- Usage documentation exists\n\n**Dependencies:**\n- dependency:F002 (Project Request work item type with stable workflow states)\n- Data access method approved (ADO Analytics/OData vs REST vs warehouse)\n- Ability to compute time-in-state from revision history or analytics snapshots\n\n**Release Plan:** NEAR (Quarter month 2)",
