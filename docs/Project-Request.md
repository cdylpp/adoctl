# Project Request
**Definition**
A project request is a well-defined request for work based on a problem statement, the value of the potential project, and the desired outcome. Project requests are specific work item types that track these requests in ADO. For more information on the process of project intake system visit [this] page.

Project requests should not be created through ADO interface, but instead should be submitted through the Black Lagoon site. After the form is submitted a series of automations transform the request into an ADO work item and is patched to ADO. 

Currently, a manual script must be run to complete the last phase which is writing the request to ADO.
